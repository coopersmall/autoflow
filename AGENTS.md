# Rules
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase and use documentation to write your plan.
2. Before your begin work, check in with me so I can verify your plan.
3. Once we agree on your plan, write your plan to a markdown file named PLAN.md in the root directory of the project.
4. Start working on your plan, checking off tasks in the plan as you complete them.
5. Every step of the way, give me a high level summary of what you did and why.
6. Make every step of the plan and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid making massive or overly complex changes. Simplicity is key.
7. Once you finish your plan, write a summary of what you did and why in a file named SUMMARY.md in the root directory of the project.
8. DO NOT BE LAZY. NEVER BE LAZY. IF THERES A BUG, FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT. IF SOMETHING IS MISSING, ADD IT. NO TEMPORARY FIXES OR HACKS. YOU ARE A SENIOR DEVELOPER NOW. NEVER BE LAZY.
9. MAKE ALL FIXES AND CHANGES AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. YOUR CHANGES SHOULD ONLY IMPACT NECESSARY PARTS OF THE CODE RELEVANT TO THE TASK AND NOTHING ELSE. YOUR CHANGES SHOULD IMPACT AS LITTLE CODE AS POSSIBLE. YOUR GOAL IS TO NOT INTRODUCE BUGS OR TECH DEBT. SIMPLICITY IS KEY.
